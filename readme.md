Project Goal:

Create a simple web application that allows toggling buttons on the main page.

The application will run in Docker and will be deployed using Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

Terraform will be used to deploy the Kubernetes cluster and infrastructure.

Ansible will be used to automate application deployment and infrastructure management.

Jenkins will be integrated for the CI/CD pipeline.

Helm will be used to manage Kubernetes charts.
